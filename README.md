# leaflet-challenge

## Challenge Details:
In this challenge I was tasked with visualizing data from The United States Geological Survey (USGS).  They maintain lots of data on earthquakes and I chose to use to connect to their data feed for earquakes with at least 2.5 magnitute over the last 30.  The data was in Json format and I used it to create a map that will will to expalin that data to other organizations and the public.  

The USGS source includes datat from all over the world, so there were plenty of datapoints. The size of the markers on the map correspond to the magnitude and the color corresponds to the depth.
